        <h2>Final Topic Proposal</h2>
        <p>
            For the final project, my plan is to create a web app that allows a user to plan out a bucket list of places to go, restaurants to eat at, and special events to go see that are specific to San Francisco and the Bay Area. I’m interested in creating the project because I will be spending the summer in San Francisco, so the project would be informative, useful, and a great way to explore a little bit of what San Francisco has to offer.

            I will create an app that will suggest possible items of interests to a person in a number of categories (food, parks, events, tourist spots, museums, etc) and also let the person add items of their own. I will possibly have a calendar feature to allow a user to schedule their summer events. I also want to use the Google Maps API to make distance/directions to the bucket list spots available, and I want users to be able to customize their bucket list with images and stories from the completed bucket list items. I will possibly use the google maps API, Yelp dataset, and SF specific datasets available at https://datasf.org/opendata/. Basically, I’m not entirely sure which elements of the bucket list are most do-able and useful, and I’m still finalizing which parts of the web app I will implement in the final version.
