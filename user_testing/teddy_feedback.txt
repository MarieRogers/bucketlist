Hi Marie,

When logging onto your website, the first think I noticed is the simplicity of use. Each page has a clear purpose, and It’s super simple to navigate between the different aspects of the website. I really like the map feature, as its a nice way to visualize the events for a day. It would be really cool if you could select certain items and only display those on the map or have some sort of day planning aspect. Even without it though, being able to look at where items are makes planning trips so much easier.

I also really enjoyed playing around with the suggestions tab. It's fun to be able to see what other people are enjoying and have a sense of community incorporated. It's also a great feature that I can make my bucket list items public or not. It’s good to know I can share what I’m doing with the world, but also keep my gems of the city to myself. 

One thing I noticed is that some of the pictures were a little slow to load. I don’t have stellar connection, but it still was a little distracting waiting for the photos to load. All in all, it was a well played out website that certainly beats keeping a list of things to do on a note in my phone!
