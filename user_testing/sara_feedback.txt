Hey Marie, 

Your app was super easy to use and I think it solves a problem that a lot of people face when they go somewhere and don't know much about the place. The layout and design is really nice too.

While I was using your app I was able to easily complete the following tasks:
1) browse suggestions as a guest
2) Create an account and login
3) Change my profile picture
4) Add bucket list items to my personal bucket list
5) Mark my bucket list items as complete, edit them, and remove them

All of these tasks were really easy and intuitive to complete.
