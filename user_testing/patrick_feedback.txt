Hey Marie, 

This is awesome. The website is incredibly easy to use with an aesthetically pleasing look and feel. The fact that it not only allows me to dynamically create my own bucket list from suggestions provided, but even completely create my own list items is the flexibility that I need in a travel app. With images, ratings, and addresses of awesome local attractions, it makes me want to move to the city! I am particularly impressed by the “recently added by another user” aspect of the bucket list items, as it shows an impressive interaction between users. The flexibility of the website in terms of dynamically creating and editing user info, along with bucket list items makes it fun and exciting to use, in addition to its tangible effectiveness. Even the ability to flawlessly edit bucket list items, mark them as completed, or delete them would allow me to easily keep track of what’s next on my list. It makes me excited to visit this San Francisco summer and hopefully check a few creative ones off!
