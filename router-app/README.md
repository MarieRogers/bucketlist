# final

> A Vue.js project

## Motivation

I built a Bucket List website specific to San Francisco, CA, because I will be living there this summer, and it seemed like a fun, applicable, and relevant way to apply the skills I gained in this course.

## Framework Decision

I was familiar with Vue which was a major factor in choosing it for this project, and I also really like the layout of components, especially for this project. I messed around with React for my explore project, but I had a more difficult time using APIs with React, and overall I liked the layout and packaging of Vue components better.

## Data

Data for the Suggestions panes is from the Google Places API, and the map capability is from the Google Maps API.

## WAVE Testing

For WAVE testing, my website has errors with contrast; however, the plugin mentions that it does not take into account a background image, so if it's not set correctly it just thinks that it is white lettering on a white background. My contrast should be good enough though to make the white lettering pass!

## User Testing

Three user tests can be found in final/user_testing

## Firebase Data

Exported JSON from Firebase can be found in final/firebaseJSON
